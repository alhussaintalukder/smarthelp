I need a mobile app for video calling. A standard Video calling mobile app. This is the first and main feature We want to complete.

Tech stack: Expo, React Native, Agora Video SDK, Redux, Axios, TypeScript, Firebase, etc. Whatever else needed.

We will complete the android part now.

expo (empty project) command:
npm install --global eas-cli && npx create-expo-app smarthelp && cd smarthelp && eas init --id 27dd8b70-5874-4fee-aba3-ebd823f51aa5

Github (Empty repository) command: "echo "# smarthelp" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/alhussaintalukder/smarthelp.git
git push -u origin main"

I want you to give me the prompt for AI coding agent like to complete the standard android video calling mobile app with these tech stack: Expo, React Native, Agora Video SDK, Redux, Axios, Firebase, etc. Whatever else needed.

So give me the best prompt for AI coding agent so I can get complete and working app.
